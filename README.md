# PRODIGY DATA SCIENCE TASK-03

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# OVERVIEW

This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# PROJECT STRUCTURE

data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.

bank-additional-full.csv: The dataset in CSV format.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

Customer_Purchase_Prediction.ipynb: The main notebook where the decision tree classifier is built and evaluated. -images/: Images and visualizations generated by the project.

decision_tree.png: Visualization of the trained decision tree.

README.md: This README file, providing an overview of the project.

# MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION

he decision tree classifier is trained using the Bank Marketing dataset.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

# RESULTS

The final decision tree classifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test data.
The trained decision tree is visualized and saved as decision_tree in Download.png.

# CONCLUSION

UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the dataset. The scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries for their contributions to machine learning and data visualization.
